One of my projects during pandemic was building out a camper van. This was a collaborative project with freshly minted van dad Michael. It also features artwork by Gerry. [`Glamper Van`](https://www.glampervan.us/) and [`FarOutRide`](https://faroutride.com/)provided design inspirations.

The van lived its past life as a humble and beaten up plumbing services vehicle. When we started, it had a leaky roof, metal shelvings attached, and an extremely dilapidated interior.

I enjoy construction projects large and small. One of my absolute favorite mediums to work with is wood. I love designing and building out furiture. While Michael laid out the electronics, I did most of the carpentry.
