excerpt: "About Mochi Liu"

---
I am a recent grad and postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University in the [Leifer Group](http://leiferlab.princeton.edu/). I build hardware and software tools that combine real-time image processing, machine learning, and optogenetics to study animal behavior and neuroscience. I also hold a BS in bioengineering with a minor in electrical engineering and computer science from UC Berkeley.

Some things I worked on prior to grad school:
- a software + database contractor (and field hand) for a fish farm 
- virology internships at Merck and the Scripps Research Institute
- undergraduate researcher at UC Berkeley studying Sudden Oak Death
